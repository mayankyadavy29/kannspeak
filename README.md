- **Basic options:**
  - **cfg** : Get full config file to see what type of pool is set and what is the current pool length. 
  - **gen** : Ask for a english word and translate it. Get the correct kannada translation.
  - **pool pool_type** : You can specify the type of pool (random, nouns, pronouns, verbs, numbers, relationships). Default is random pool. You will get words only from this pool.
This is very helpful if you want to learn specific set of words like only pronouns or verbs etc.

  - **help** : This will list down all the options available.
 - **Why you should use this app:**
   - Most of the times when you start learning a new language, you get a lot of information thrown at you. For eg. you have to know the correct usage of verb when used in past, present or future tense. The usage will also change when used with different types of pronouns. This becomes very exhausting and people generally lose interest. This app makes sure that you only learn the base verb not any of its associations with other words.
   - It will start from most used words in the pool. So, you will start by learning these words first which are more relevant.
   - You can set what type of words you want to learn using by choosing the appropriate pool.
   - You can set the number of words from which a random word will be picked uo. Let's say you have set this length to 10. So, you will always get a word from a fixed set of 10 words. This way when you see the same word again and again it will be easy to learn it. This is a very useful feature. In future, we will also provide sentences where this word has been used.
   - The main aim of this project is to ease learning Kannada and not to make it an overwhelming experience which might scare you. It is fine to learn bits and pieces of a language rather than knowing the correct grammer. It atleast shows the good intent of learner which is always appreciated by the native speakers.
